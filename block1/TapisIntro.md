## The Tapis project
**Tapis** is an open source, NSF funded Application Program Interface (API) platform for distributed computation that will provide production-grade capabilities to enable researchers.

* Securely execute workflows that span geographically **distributed** providers.
* Store and retrieve **streaming/sensor** data for real-time and batch job processing, with support for temporal and spatial  indexes and queries.
* Leverage containerized codes to enable **portability**, and reduce the overall time-to-solution by utilizing data locality and other **smart scheduling** techniques. 
* Improve **repeatability** and **reproducibility** of computations with history and provenance tracking built into the API.
* Manage access to data and results through a fine-grained **permissions** model, so that digital assets can be **securely** shared  with colleagues or the community at large.
